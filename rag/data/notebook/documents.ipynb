In the two\\nyears that the institute has been in operation,\\nit has created quite a few prototypes that go\\nbeyond the kind of things that have tradi-\\ntionally been built under the heading of edu-\\ncational software. Behind these new designs\\nare a number of radically different “teaching\\narchitectures” that change the nature of how\\nstudents interact with computers, moving\\nfrom what is called “the page-turning archi-\\ntecture” to architectures based on simulation-\\ndriven learning by doing, story- or case-based\\nteaching, and Socratic dialogues (Schank\\n1990a; Schank and Jona 1991).\\nThese prototypes have been successful, and\\nfor the most part, the institute’s sponsors have\\nbeen impressed with the results, acknowledg-\\ning that they have never seen anything quite\\nlike them before. Nevertheless, researchers at\\nthe institute have been plagued by a curious\\nkind of question when they show these pro-\\ntotypes to certain audiences. The question\\nthey keep hearing is the title of this article:\\nWhere’s the AI?\\nAt first, I found this question puzzling.\\nEverything they do is AI. But apparently, AI\\nhas a specific definition to many people, and\\nthese programs didn’t fit this definition. My\\nconcern was to figure out what this definition\\nwas. And while I am at it, maybe it would be\\nhelpful if the field of AI itself understood the\\nanswer to this question in a more profound\\nway. It is not that AI needs definition; it is\\nmore that AI needs substance, a distinction\\nthat I discuss later.\\nFour Viewpoints on AI\\nWhen someone who is not in AI asks where\\nthe AI is, what assumptions about AI are\\ninherent in the question? There seem to be at\\nleast four prevailing viewpoints that I have to\\ndeal with, so this question assumes at least\\none of the following four things: (1) AI means\\nmagic bullets, (2) AI means inference engines,\\n(3) AI means getting a machine to do some-\\nthing you didn’t think a machine could do\\n(the “gee whiz” view), and (4) AI means\\nhaving a machine learn.\\nThe magic bullet view of AI is as follows:\\nIntelligence is actually difficult to put into a\\nmachine because it is knowledge dependent.\\nBecause the knowledge-acquisition process is\\ncomplex, one way to address it is to finesse it.\\nLet the machine be efficient computationally\\nso that it can connect things to each other\\nwithout having to explicitly represent any-\\nthing. In this way, the intelligence comes for\\nfree as a by-product of unanticipated connec-\\ntions that the machine makes.\\nAn alternate version of this view is that AI\\nis something that one could, in principle, dis-\\ncover in one’s garage. What the form of this\\ndiscovery might be remains a mystery, but\\none would drop the discovered item or tech-\\nnique into the machine, and it would become\\nintelligent. This view is held, quite firmly, by\\nmany people who write me letters after\\nhaving read my name in a magazine article as\\nwell as by many venture capitalists (and, pos-\\nsibly, some connectionists).\\nThe inference engine view of AI was\\nbrought forth by a variety of people on the\\nWest Coast (for example, the MYCIN [Shortliffe\\n1976] and DENDRAL [Buchanan and Feigen-\\nbaum 1978] projects at Stanford University\\nand the PROSPECTOR [Duda, Gaschnig, and Hart\\n1979] project at SRI International). Their view\\nwas, I suspect, an answer to this same ques-\\ntion. When the expert system world began to\\nexplode, AI experts were expert at finding out\\nwhat an expert knew and writing down the\\nknowledge in rules that a machine could\\nfollow (this process came to be known as\\nknowledge engineering [Feigenbaum 1977]).\\nAlthough such expert systems could, in fact,\\nmake some interesting decisions, business\\ntypes who were called on to evaluate the\\npotential of such systems probably asked,\\nWhere’s the AI? The real answer was that the\\nAI was in the ability of AI people to find out\\nwhat the experts knew and to represent the\\nArticles\\nWINTER 1991    39\\nIt is not that AI needs definition; it is more that AI needs \\nsubstance…'),\n",

There had to be something that could be\\nlabeled AI and that something came to be\\nknown as an inference engine.1 Of course,\\nmuch of the AI world understood that infer-\\nence was an important part of understanding,\\nso it made sense that an expert system would\\nneed to make inferences too, but to label the\\ninference engine as the AI was both mislead-\\ning and irrelevant. The business world\\nbelieved that it needed this label, however, as\\nI discuss later on.\\nThus, it came to pass that business people\\nwho read about AI and assumed that AI and\\nexpert systems were identical began to expect\\ninference engines in anything they saw on a\\ncomputer that “had AI in it.” Many other\\npeople in AI were left in a quandary, however,\\nabout how to explain that what they did was\\nalso AI, which led to questions such as, What\\nis AI anyway? This question was never easy to\\nanswer without discussing the nature of intel-\\nligence, a subject best left undiscussed in a\\nbusiness meeting.\\nI term the next view the gee whiz view.\\nThis view maintains that for a particular task,\\nif no machine ever did it before, it must be\\nAI. Two important types of programs to dis-\\ncuss within this conception of AI are optical\\ncharacter readers and chess-playing programs.\\nAre these programs AI? Today, most people\\nwould say that they are not. Years ago, they\\nwere.2 What happened?\\nThe answer is that they worked. They were\\nAI as long as it was unclear how to make them\\nwork. When all the engineering was done,\\nand they worked well enough to be used by\\nreal people, they ceased to be seen as AI.\\nWhy? The answer is threefold: First, “gee\\nwhiz” only lasts so long. After a while, people\\nget used to the idea that a computer can do\\nsomething they didn’t know it could do.\\nSecond, people tend to confuse getting a\\nmachine to do something intelligent with\\ngetting it to be a model of human intelligence,\\nand surely, these programs aren’t intelligent\\nin any deep sense. Third, the bulk of the work\\nrequired to transform an AI prototype into an\\nunbreakable computer program looks a lot\\nmore like software engineering than it does\\nlike AI to the programmers who are working\\non the system, so it doesn’t feel like you are\\ndoing AI even when you are.\\nThe fourth view of AI is one that I myself\\nhave espoused. It is a long-term view. It says\\nthat intelligence entails learning. When your\\ndog fails to understand his environment and\\nimprove on mistakes he has made, you refer\\nto him as “dumb.” Intelligence means getting\\nbetter over time. No system that is static, that\\nfails to change as a result of its experiences,\\nlooks smart. Real AI means a machine that\\nlearns. The problem with this definition is\\nthat according to it, no one has actually done\\nany AI at all, although some researchers have\\nmade some interesting attempts.3 According\\nto this view, there is no AI, at least not yet.\\nThus the question, Where’s the AI? is a tough\\none to answer.\\nKnowing Something Helps,\\nKnowing a Lot Helps More\\nLet’s consider the SAM-FRUMP-ATRANS experience.\\nIn 1976, a group of my students and myself\\nbuilt SAM, a program that summarized, para-\\nphrased, translated, and answered questions\\nabout newspaper stories (Cullingford 1978,\\n1981). The program was slow and cumber-\\nsome and was capable of reading only a few\\nstories in a few domains. Nevertheless, it was\\nthe first program to perform this task, and we\\nwere proud of it. No one asked where the AI\\nwas because no one had ever seen anything\\nlike it. It qualified as AI based on the gee whiz\\ncriterion.\\nIn 1978, we attempted to improve on SAM\\nin some ways, thus came FRUMP (DeJong\\n1979b). FRUMP was very fast in comparison to\\nSAM. By this time, we had even faster machines\\nof course, but the major speedups were\\naccomplished by limiting inferencing and\\nattempting to understand only the gist of any\\ngiven story. We were able to blur the distinc-\\ntion between inferencing and parsing in a\\nway that made interesting theoretical claims\\n(DeJong 1979a).\\nWe were excited by FRUMP. It worked on\\nroughly 50 different domains and succeeded\\non about 75 percent of the stories that were\\nin these domains. The branch of the United\\nStates Department of Defense that had spon-\\nsored this work wanted to use FRUMP for a par-\\nticular task. We were put in the strange\\nposition (for a university research lab) of\\nhaving to hire people to code domain knowl-\\nedge into FRUMP. After a year of this coding,\\nFRUMP’s robustness had only slightly improved,\\nand the sponsor was annoyed because it had\\nactually wanted to use the program. Further, I\\nwas concerned about having to hire more\\nand more non-AI people to make a piece of\\nsoftware really work. I had always thought\\nthat our research money was for supporting\\ngraduate students to do research. I was\\nuneasy about actually trying to develop a\\nproduct. And it didn’t interest me all that\\nmuch to try. What did it mean to be doing\\n…the gee \\nwhiz view…\\nmaintains\\nthat…if no\\nmachine ever\\ndid it before,\\nit must be AI.'),\n",

It meant building theories\\nand programmed examples of these theories,\\nit seemed to me, in the attempt to understand\\nthe nature of the mind as part of the ultimate\\nquest for the learning machine of the fourth\\nviewpoint given earlier. In 1978, I was not\\ninterested in building products.\\nBy 1982, though, I had become interested\\nin trying to build AI products. Why? Probably\\nthe main thing that had changed was AI. The\\nexpert system hype had hit, and the venture\\ncapitalists were everywhere. I spoke loudly\\nand often against this overhype and ran a\\npanel that year at the National Conference on\\nArtificial Intelligence (held at Carnegie-Mellon\\nUniversity in Pittsburgh) on the coming AI\\nwinter that was likely to result from ridicu-\\nlous expectations.4 At the same time, I had\\nbegun to think more and more about the\\nFRUMP experience. I realized that AI people\\nreally had to produce something that worked\\nat some point, that we couldn’t simply write\\npapers about ideas that might work or worked\\non a few examples and satisfied the sponsors\\nwho were pouring real money into AI. With\\nthe increase in money coming from the com-\\nmercial world, the die was cast. We had to\\nproduce something then, I figured, or we\\nmight not get another chance. Thus, I, too,\\nstarted a company, called Cognitive Systems,\\nwith FRUMP as the intended product.\\nWhy FRUMP never was the product of Cogni-\\ntive Systems is a business discussion not rele-\\nvant here. What Cognitive Systems did wind\\nup building was something called ATRANS,\\nwhich was a program that read international\\nbank money transfer messages (Lytinen and\\nGershman 1986). The program is working\\ntoday in various international banks. It parses\\nsentences that all have similar content about\\nhow and where money is to be transferred\\nfrom country to country. In essence, ATRANS is\\na single-domain (and a narrow domain at\\nthat) FRUMP. A version of this program is also\\nused by the United States Coast Guard. At a\\nDefense Department meeting three years ago,\\nATRANS was identified as one of only three AI\\nprograms actually in use for defense.\\nWhy am I telling you all this? Because there\\nis 1 important fact to know about ATRANS. It\\ntook something like 30 person-years to make\\nit work. This number is in addition to any of\\nthe SAM-FRUMP work. There is an important\\nlesson to be learned here.\\nTo make AI—real AI—programs that do\\nsomething someone might want (which is,\\nafter all, the goal of AI for those who fund AI\\nand for many of those in AI), one must do a\\ngreat deal of work that doesn’t look like AI.\\nAny of Cognitive Systems’ programmers\\nwould have been justified in complaining\\nthat they had come to work there to do AI,\\nand all they were doing was working on end-\\nless details about determining various abbre-\\nviations for bank names. They also asked,\\nWhere’s the AI?\\nThe lesson to be learned from ATRANS is\\nsimple enough. AI entails massive software\\nengineering. To paraphrase Thomas Edison,\\n“AI is 1-percent inspiration and 99-percent\\nperspiration.” AI people will never build any\\nreal AI unless they are willing to make the\\ntremendously complex effort that is involved\\nin making sophisticated software work.\\nBut this discussion still doesn’t answer the\\noriginal question. Sponsors can still honestly\\ninquire about where the AI is, even if it is in\\nonly 1 percent of the completed work.\\nFrom Three Examples to Many\\nThe answer to Where’s the AI? is that it’s in\\nthe size. Let me explain.\\nFor years, AI people specialized in building\\nsystems that worked on only a few examples\\nor in a limited domain (or microworld).\\nSometimes these systems didn’t really work\\non any examples at all; it just seemed plausi-\\nble that they would work. The practice of get-\\nting AI programs to work on a few examples\\nis so rooted in the history of AI that it is\\nrarely discussed. There are many reasons for\\nthis practice, but the simplest explanation is\\nthat until the creation of the various venture\\ncapital backed companies in the early 1980s,\\nalmost all AI programs were Ph.D. theses that\\nproved the concept of the thesis with a few\\nexamples. It was almost never anyone’s job to\\nfinish the thesis.5 Often, it wasn’t clear what\\nthis finishing meant anyway because these\\ntheses were rarely directed at real problems\\nfor which there was a user waiting. In any\\ncase, even if there was a ready use for the pro-\\nject, no one wanted to tackle the inherently\\nuninteresting task of doing all that software\\nengineering—at least no one in an AI lab\\nwanted to. And even if someone did want to\\ndo it, there was no one who wanted to pay\\nfor it or who seriously understood how much\\nit would really cost to do the other 99 percent.\\nNevertheless, there were otherwise intelligent\\npeople claiming that Winograd’s (1972) SHRDLU\\nprogram that worked on 31 examples had\\nsolved the natural language problem or that\\nMYCIN (Shortliffe 1976) had solved the prob-\\nlem of getting expertise into a computer.6\\nPrior to 1982, it is safe to say that no one had\\nArticles\\nWINTER 1991    41'),\n",

This measure of AI was one of those\\nthings that was so clearly a defining charac-\\nteristic of the field that there was no need to\\nactually define it on paper, at least I am\\nunaware of any specific statement of this view\\nof what was AI in the 1960s and 1970s that we\\nall adhered to. So I will say it now. And true\\nto form, I will say it in the form of a story:\\nWhen I arrived at Yale in 1974, there was a\\njunior faculty member there who, I was told,\\nwas in AI. I looked into what he was doing\\nand decided that he was not in AI. Here was\\nwhat happened: He was working on speech\\nrecognition. He had developed an algorithm\\nfor detecting which of the numbers 1 through\\n10 had been spoken into a computer. As far as\\nI could tell, the program did what it claimed\\nto do. I asked, as any AI person would, how\\nthe program had accomplished the task. The\\nquestion was not what he had done but how\\nhe had done it. Here’s why.\\nSuppose his program had determined\\nwhich of the numbers 1 through 10 had been\\nsaid by comparing the sound that was received\\nto a prototype of what each of the 10 num-\\nbers should sound like and then determining\\nthe best match of the features of the incom-\\ning sound to the features of the prototype.\\nThis method seems like a reasonable one for\\nperforming this task, and it should work.\\nWhy then isn’t it AI?\\nIt isn’t AI because it is unlikely that it would\\nscale up. The key concepts here are “scaleup”\\nand “unlikely.” If the problem that this man\\nwas working on was the “detection of 10\\nnumbers” problem, it really wouldn’t matter\\nhow he did it. Any algorithm that worked\\nwould be terrific if someone wanted a pro-\\ngram to do this task. But AI has always been\\nconcerned with the solution of the deep\\nproblem behind the small problem. The issue\\nin this part of AI was how a program would\\ndetect any word that was spoken, and the\\nsolution being proposed, to be an AI solution,\\nhad to address this issue. In other words, the\\nquestion that I asked myself was whether\\nwhat he had done for 10 words would work\\nfor any word. That is the AI question.\\nNow, obviously, I decided that his solution\\n(which was indeed the one given earlier)\\nwould not scale up. This conclusion was easy\\nto come to because for it to scale up, he would\\nbe proposing matching any new word to a\\ndatabase of hundreds of thousands of proto-\\ntypes. He had not even begun to think about\\nthis type of matching because he was really\\nnot an AI person in any sense of the word. He\\nwas simply working on a problem that looked\\nlike AI to an outsider.\\nSuppose he had been thinking about doing\\nspeech recognition as a step-by-step differen-\\ntiation process. At the time, I would have \\nsaid that this approach was silly, that what\\nwas needed was a theory of recognition of\\nphonemes in the context of predictions\\nderived from language understanding in real\\nsituations. It is at this point that “unlikely”\\ncomes in. I was, after all, simply guessing\\nabout whether his system would scale up. It\\nwas a good guess because he hadn’t thought\\nabout anything except 10 words, and it is\\nunlikely that his solution for 10 words was\\ngoing to happen to work for all words. What\\nbothers me about this story today is that\\nalthough I would still like to see speech recog-\\nnition driven by a good theory of language\\nunderstanding, it is nevertheless now possible\\nto conceive of a program that really does\\nstore all the words of English and compare\\none to another. Would this program be AI?\\nCertainly, there are those who would say\\nthat it was AI. This debate aside for the\\nmoment, it is possible to come to a point of\\nview that defines AI as one of two things:\\nEither an AI program is one based on a theory\\nthat is likely to scale up, or it is a program\\nbased on an algorithm that is likely to scale up.\\nEither way, I am talking about best guesses\\nabout promises for the future.\\nThe point here is that the AI is in the size\\nor at least the potential size. The curiosity\\nhere is that when the size gets big enough, it\\nall ceases to matter. We merely need to look\\nat AI work in chess.\\nChess was one of the original AI problems.\\nGetting a machine to do something that only\\nsmart people can do seemed a good area for\\nAI to work on. Now, many years later, you\\ncan buy a chess-playing program in a toy\\nstore, and no one claims that it is an AI pro-\\ngram. What happened?\\nFor many years, the popular wisdom was\\nthat AI was a field that killed its own success-\\nes. If you couldn’t do it, the wisdom went, it\\nwas AI, and when you did it, it no longer was,\\nwhich seems to be what happened in chess,\\nbut the reality is somewhat more subtle.\\nChess was an AI problem because it represent-\\ned one form of intelligent behavior. The task\\nin AI was to create intelligent machines,\\nwhich meant having them exhibit intelligent\\nbehavior. The problem was—and is—that'),\n",

But the chess work didn’t\\nscale up at all, so the reasonableness of doing\\nsuch work is simply a question of whether\\nthis work was needed by anybody. If there\\nhad been a need for chess programs, then\\nchess would have been seen as a success of AI\\nbut probably not as actual AI. In the end, AI\\nwas never supposed to be about need, however.\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, most AI people didn’t\\ncare if someone wanted a particular program\\nor not. AI was research.\\nThe correct AI question had to do with the\\ngenerality of a solution to a problem, and\\nthere was a good reason. It is trivial to build a\\nprogram to do what, say, Winograd’s (1972)\\nSHRDLU program did for 31 sentences. Just\\nmatch 31 strings with 31 behaviors. It would\\ntake a day to program. People believed that\\nWinograd’s program was an AI program\\nbecause they believed that his program “did it\\nright.” They believed it would scale up. They\\nbelieved that it would work on more than 31\\nsentences. (In fact, so did he. See Winograd\\n[1973]). At the time, when I was asked my\\nopinion of Winograd’s work, I replied that it\\nwould never work on a substantially larger\\nnumber of sentences, nor would it work in\\ndifferent domains than the one for which it\\nwas designed. I did not reply that his program\\nwas not AI, however.\\nThe fact that a program does not scale up\\ndoes not necessarily disqualify it from being\\nAI. The ideas in Winograd’s program were AI\\nideas; they just weren’t correct AI ideas in my\\nopinion. What then does it mean for a pro-\\ngram to have AI ideas within it? After all, this\\nquestion is a key one in our search to find the\\nlocation of the AI.\\nSo to summarize the argument so far, an AI\\nprogram exhibits intelligent behavior, but a\\nnon-AI program could as well. An AI program\\nshould scale up, but many do not. And an AI\\nprogram has AI ideas in it. Further, an AI pro-\\ngram is not intended to accomplish a particu-\\nlar task but rather to help shed light on\\nsolutions for a set of tasks. This summary was,\\nmore or less, the standard view of AI within\\nAI prior to 1980.\\nArticles\\nWINTER 1991    43\\nexactly what constitutes intelligent behavior\\nis not exactly agreed on. With my scaleup\\nmeasure, the idea in looking at a chess pro-\\ngram would have been to ask how its solution\\nto the chess problem scaled up. Or to put it\\nanother way, were people writing chess pro-\\ngrams because they wanted computers to play\\nchess well, or were they writing them because\\nthey scaled up to other problems of intelli-\\ngent behavior?\\nIt would seem that no one would want a\\nchess program for any real purpose, but this\\nquestion, after all, is a marketing one. If the\\ntoys made money, well, fine: It doesn’t matter\\nhow they work; it matters that they work. But\\nif we care about how they work, there are\\nonly two possible questions: First, we need to\\nknow if the solution to making them work\\ntells us anything at all about human behavior.\\nSecond, we would want to know if it tells us\\nsomething that we could use in any program\\nthat did something similar to, but more gen-\\neral than, playing chess.\\nBrute-force, high-speed search through a\\ntable of possible prestored moves is unlikely\\nto be anything like the human method for\\nchess playing. Chess players do seem to\\nunderstand the game they are playing and are\\nable to explain strategies, and so on, after all.\\nThus, the only other question is whether one\\ncould use these same methods to help tell us\\nsomething about how to solve problems in\\ngeneral. In fact, the original motivation to\\nwork on chess in AI was bound up with the\\nidea of a general problem solver (for example,\\nNewell and Simon’s [1963] GPS system). The\\ndifficulty is that what was learned from this\\nwork was that people are really specific prob-\\nlem solvers more than they are general prob-\\nlem solvers and that the real generalizations\\nto be found are in how knowledge is to be\\nrepresented and applied in specific situations.\\nBrute-force chess programs shed no light on\\nthis issue at all and, thus, are usually deemed\\nnot to be AI.\\nThus, the scaleup problem can refer to\\nscaleup within a domain as well as to scaleup\\nin the greater domains that naturally embody\\n…an AI program is not intended to accomplish a particular\\ntask but rather to help shed light on solutions for a set of tasks.'),\n",

It wasn’t in the infer-\\nence engine at all. These inference engines\\nwere, after all, pretty simple pieces of software\\nthat tested to see if the logic of the rules that\\nthe knowledge engineers wrote came up with\\nany conclusions. The AI in complex expert\\nsystems was in the organization and represen-\\ntation of knowledge, the attempt to under-\\nstand the domain under study, and the\\ncrystallization of what was important in the\\ndomain and how experts in the domain rea-\\nsoned. Now, I was saying at the time (see, for\\nexample, Schank et al. [1977]) that the AI was\\nalso in collecting the actual experiences of the\\nexperts and indexing them so that reminding\\nand, hence, learning could take place, but the\\nexpert system folks were in no mood to pay\\nattention. Those that did were usually not\\ninvolved in the shell game. To put it another\\nway, the AI was where it always was—in the\\nattempt to understand the intelligent behav-\\nior in the system being modeled.\\nThe fact that no expert ever experiences\\nanything in his(her) domain of expertise\\nwithout learning something from the experi-\\nence and changing in some way was easily\\nignored.7 The hope was that static systems\\nwould model an expert’s reasoning ability at\\nany moment. But experts don’t remain experts\\nfor long if all they do is blindly apply rules.\\nThe act of creating a shell with which non-AI\\npeople could write rules to be run by an infer-\\nence engine was, in a sense, an act of not\\ndoing AI. What had been left out was the skill\\nthat AI people had been learning all this time,\\nthe skill of figuring out what was going on in\\na domain and getting a machine to model the\\nhuman behavior that occurred in the domain.\\nWhat had been left out were the AI ideas.\\nSome companies tried to remedy this situa-\\ntion by training the users of these new shells\\nto become knowledge engineers. But AI is\\nkind of a funny subject. For years, we have\\nbeen taking graduates from the best institu-\\ntions in the country and teaching them AI.\\nOften, even after a few years, they just don’t\\nget it. What don’t they get? They don’t get\\nwhat the issues are, how to attack an issue,\\nhow to have an idea about an unsolved prob-\\nlem, and how to build programs that embody\\nthese ideas. AI is a way of looking at complex\\nproblems, and often, it is difficult to learn to\\ndo. It seemed to me that it was hopeless to try\\nto teach this area to programmers in a few\\nweeks when years often didn’t help.\\nThus, my claim is that although some\\nexpert systems might well have been AI, few\\nof those built with inference engines were\\nlikely to be unless one changed the then-\\ncurrent definition of AI. The change is easy\\nenough to describe. AI had been the creation\\nof new ideas about how to represent and use\\ncomplex knowledge on a computer. Now, the\\ndefinition was changing toward AI being pro-\\ngrams that utilized these AI ideas in some\\napplication that someone wanted.\\nWhere was the AI in the expert system\\nshells? It was in the assertion that rules would\\neffectively model expertise and in the programs\\nthat attempted to implement this assertion.\\nThe only problem was that for complex\\ndomains—that is, for AI-like domains of\\ninquiry—the assertion was wrong.\\nThe Larger the Better\\nOne of the real issues in AI, as I mentioned\\nearlier, is size. When we talk about scaleup,\\nwe are, of course, talking about working on\\nmore than a few examples. What every AI\\nperson knows is that a program that works on\\n5 examples is probably not one-tenth the size\\nof one that works on 50. Outsiders imagine\\nthat it might be the same size or, possibly,\\none-half the size. But what is really the case is\\nthat for real domains, the size changes work\\nthe other way. Once you have to account for\\nall the myriad possibilities, the complexity is\\nphenomenal. It is critical, if AI is to mean\\napplications of AI ideas rather than simply\\nthe creation of these ideas, that size issues be\\nattacked seriously. No one needs a program\\nthat does 5 examples. This approach worked\\nin 1970 because AI was new and glossy. It \\nwill not work any longer. Too much money\\nhas been spent. AI has to dive headlong into\\nsize issues.\\nNow, as it turns out, although this issue\\nmight seem to be annoying and, possibly,\\ndull as dust, the truth is that it is size that is\\nat the core of human intelligence. In my\\nrecent book, Tell Me a Story (Schank 1990b), \\nI argue that people are really best seen as\\nstory-telling machines, ready to tell you their\\nfavorite story at a moment’s notice. People\\nrarely say anything that is new or something\\nthey have never said before. Looked at in this\\nway, conversation is dependent on the art of\\nindexing, finding the right thing to say at the\\nright time.8 This problem is pretty trivial for\\nsomeone who only has three stories to tell.\\nMuch like our speech-recognition friend earlier,\\nit is simply a problem of differentiation.\\nArticles\\nWINTER 1991    45'),\n",

AI is in a rather weird\\nstate these days. AI people are hoping to live\\nthe way they lived in the 1970s but for a vari-\\nety of reasons, those days are over. We cannot\\ncontinue to build programs that we hope will\\nscale up. We must scale them up ourselves.\\nIt might be that one can argue that we are\\nnot ready to face the scaleup issue just yet,\\nthat the fundamental problems have not\\nbeen solved, that we don’t know all there is\\nto know about the mind and how to model\\nit. This statement seems fair enough, not to\\nmention true enough. Nevertheless, because\\nof the realities of the 1990s, we must give it a\\ntry. There are things we can do, and there are\\nsome good reasons to try. For one thing,\\nsponsors will expect it. For another thing, the\\nproblems of AI demand it—we simply must\\nstart to look at the scaleup problems for the\\nsound theoretical reason that these consider-\\nations will force us to address many real AI\\nproblems. But I think the most important\\nreason is that this is where the action has to\\ntake place. The sheer amount of difficulty\\npresent in the creation of a functioning piece\\nof software from a prototype that worked on\\na few examples is frightening. We simply\\nmust learn how to deal with these issues, or\\nthere never will be any AI.

To get\\nmachines to be intelligent, they must be able\\nto access and modify a tremendously large\\nknowledge base. There is no intelligence\\nwithout real—and changeable—knowledge.\\nAnd this thought, of course, brings us back\\nto the original question: If a system is small,\\ncan there be AI in it? In the 1970s, AI systems\\nwere all, in essence, promises for the future.\\nThey were promises about potential scaleup,\\npromises that the theoretical basis of the pro-\\ngram was sound enough to allow scaleup.\\nNow, the question is, How big is big enough\\nto declare a system an AI system?\\nIt is fairly clear that although this question\\nis an important one, it is rather difficult to\\nanswer, which brings us back to the implicit\\nissue in this discussion—the concept of an AI\\nidea.

When\\nwe start to build useful systems, the second\\none should be easier to build than the first,\\nand we should be able to train non-AI experts\\nto build them. I don’t mean that these tools\\nwill allow everyone to do AI on their personal\\ncomputers. It does mean that certain standard\\narchitectures should evolve for capturing and\\nfinding knowledge. From this point of view,\\nthe shell game people were right; they just\\nput the wrong stuff in the shell. The shell\\nshould have had expert knowledge about var-\\nious domains in it, knowledge that is avail-\\nable to make the next system in the domain\\nthat much easier to build.\\nThese five issues are real and important to\\nthink about. They are practical points, not\\ntheoretical ones. A little practicality might\\nhelp the field get to the next level of theory.\\nOK, But What Do You \\nReally Think?\\nAI depends on computers that have real\\nknowledge in them. Thus, the crux of AI is \\nin the representation of this knowledge, the\\ncontent-based indexing of this knowledge,\\nand the adaptation and modification of this\\nknowledge through the exercise of this\\nknowledge. What I really think is that case-\\nbased reasoning (Riesbeck and Schank 1989;\\nJona and Kolodner 1991) is a much more\\npromising area than expert systems ever were\\nand that within the area of case-based reason-\\ning, the most useful and important (and\\nmaybe even somewhat easier) area to work in\\nis case-based teaching. Building real, large,\\ncase bases and then using them as a means by\\nwhich users of a system can learn is a problem\\nwe can attack now that has enormous import\\nfor both AI and the users of such systems.\\nCase-based teaching depends on solving\\nthe following problems: the indexing of\\nmemory chunks, the setting up of tasks based\\non indexing, the matching of student state to\\nan index, the anticipation of the next question,\\nknowledge navigation, problem cascades,\\nSocratic teaching, and button-based interaction.\\nI will not bother to explain each of these\\nproblems because I have done so elsewhere\\n(Schank 1991). The major point is that even\\nthough getting machines to tell what they\\nknow at relevant times is a simpler form of AI\\nthan the full-blown AI problem, it is not\\nsimple. Even the kind of practical, develop-\\nmental form of AI that I am proposing is full\\nof enough complex problems to keep many a\\ntheoretician busy. I would just like theoreti-\\ncally minded AI people to stop counting\\nangels on the head of a pin.\\nSo where is the AI? It is in the size, the\\nideas, and the understanding of what is sig-\\nnificant that contributes to the behavior of\\nintelligent beings.\\nNotes\\n1.

Physical and physiological attributes of\\nfemale volleyball players—a review. J Strength Cond Res 24(7):\\n1963–1973, 2010—The main objective of this article was to\\nreview a series of studies (n = 31) on physical attributes,\\nphysiological attributes, and on-court performances of female\\nvolleyball players. Empirical and practical knowledge emerging\\nfrom studies on training-related issues in volleyball, such as\\nbody mass, fat-free mass, aerobic proﬁle, strength, and agility\\nand speed, should be integrated and applied when planning\\nannual training programs for volleyball players. Based on our\\nreview, it was found that (a) players of a higher skill level are\\ntaller, somewhat heavier, and have higher vertical jump values\\nthan players of a lower level; (b) the aerobic proﬁle of female\\nvolleyball players is similar to that of female basketball players;\\n(c) ballistic resistance training can increase vertical jump values\\nin female volleyball players; and (d) preseason conditioning\\nshould\\nbe\\nconducted\\nto\\nprevent\\nfatigue\\nand\\nreduced\\nperformance at the beginning of the season.

Relevant informa-\\ntion on training-related issues, such as physical attributes (e.g.,\\nheight, body mass, and fat-free mass), physiological attributes\\n(e.g., aerobic proﬁle, strength, vertical jump ability, and agility\\nand speed), and on-court data (e.g., heart rate and blood\\nlactate level), can be effectively implemented in volleyball\\nprograms, particularly in strength and conditioning programs\\nspeciﬁcally developed for the female volleyball player.\\nAn attempt was made in this article to integrate knowledge\\non physical attributes, physiological attributes, and on-court\\nperformances of female volleyball players that can be applied\\nby those involved in the short- and long-term planning\\nprocesses of annual training programs. This integrated\\nknowledge can be also beneﬁcial when these professionals\\nassess the contribution of their programs to the development\\nof the female volleyball players. However, a careful approach\\nshould be adopted by those professionals who work with\\nvolleyball players in the implementation of knowledge gained\\nfrom studies on female volleyball players. This is to say that\\nthe methodological limitations of these studies, and any\\nmeasurement issues associated with the physical tests given to\\nthe players in these studies, should be taken into account.\\nThe purpose of the current article is threefold: (a) to\\nreview a series of studies (n = 31) on physical attributes,\\nphysiological attributes, and on-court performances of female\\nvolleyball players, including professional players, national\\nteam players, and university intercollegiate players; (b) to\\ndiscuss a number of methodological concerns and testing\\nlimitations associated with the reviewed studies; and (c) to\\nprovide practical recommendations for volleyball coaches\\nand strength and conditioning coaches who work with\\nfemale volleyball players.\\nThe reviewed articles were selected from an extensive\\nsearch of the English language literature, including major\\ncomputerized databases (PubMed and SPORT Discus) and\\nBRIEF REVIEW\\nAddress correspondence to Dr. Ronnie Lidor, lidor@wincol.ac.il.\\n24(7)/1963–1973\\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\\n\\x01 2010 National Strength and Conditioning Association\\nVOLUME 24 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2010 | 1963'),\n",

Search terms included, among\\nothers, volleyball, volleyball physiology, and volleyball play-\\ners. Articles on adolescent players and those articles\\ncombining data for female and male players were excluded.\\nThirty-one articles matching our criteria were included in our\\nreview.\\nPHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES\\nA summary of the physical attributes for the female volleyball\\nplayers across the reviewed studies is presented in Table 1.\\nThe reviewed data reveal several noteworthy ﬁndings.\\nHeight and body mass values vary between 164.3 6\\n4.0 cm (7) and 62.5 6 8.0 kg (13) to 187 6 5.4 cm (23)\\nand 75.1 6 7.4 kg (5), respectively. These variations in the\\ndata can be because of a number of factors, such as\\nthe genetic proﬁle of the players, their level of play, and the\\nselection process they underwent.\\nPhysical characteristics can differentiate among players of\\ndifferent levels. Although 1 study (9) indicated no differences\\nin height and body mass between national and university\\nlevel players, other studies showed that players of higher\\nlevels are taller and somewhat heavier than players playing at\\nlower levels (3,12,21,32). In one study (21), the differences\\nbetween players of different positions in divisions A1 and A2\\nin the Greek ﬁrst national league were examined. Hitters,\\ncenters, and setters were signiﬁcantly taller in division A1\\n(181.2 6 4.5, 182.0 6 4.6, and 176.9 6 4.1 cm, respectively)\\ncompared to division A2 (173.4 6 6.2, 178.7 6 4.9, and\\n170.9 6 4.2 cm, respectively). No differences in body mass\\nwere found between players of the 2 divisions. Differences in\\npercent body fat were found only in opposites (A1: 20.5 6\\n3.0% vs. A2: 25.7 6 3.4%). In this study (21), the physical\\ncharacteristics between players playing various positions\\nwere also compared, and it was found that liberos appear to\\nbe smaller than players in other positions (except for setters).\\nIn addition, centers and opposites were taller compared to\\nhitters, liberos, and setters.\\nThree studies examined changes in physical characteristics\\nover time (10,13,17). No changes in body mass, percent fat,\\nand fat-free mass were observed after a supervised off-season\\nstrength and conditioning program of NCAA division I\\nplayers (10). In another study (17), percent fat of NCAA\\nDivision I players increased and fat-free mass decreased at\\nthe end of the competition phase of the season compared to\\nbaseline values, whereas body mass remained stable. In\\ncontrast, another study (13) revealed slight decreases in\\npercent fat throughout the entire season. Although an\\nincrease in percent fat can hinder performance, it should be\\nnoted that the changes indicated in all studies were small and\\ncould have been affected, at least in part, by the accuracy of\\nthe type of instruments used and the measuring methods. In\\naddition, even if the data reﬂect actual changes in body\\ncomposition, this does not necessarily mean that these\\nchanges inﬂuenced performance. Body composition can vary\\nover time, as Johnson et al. (17) suggested, and therefore,\\na range of values rather than one strict value should be set for\\neach individual player.\\nComparing volleyball players to players of other team\\nsports and to nonathletes can shed light on the physical\\nattributes that are unique to those players. In one study (25),\\nintercollegiate volleyball players were signiﬁcantly taller\\nand had higher body mass and fat-free mass compared to\\nnonathletes. Compared to intercollegiate basketball play-\\ners, the volleyball players had shorter arms but shared\\nsimilar height and body mass. In another study (4), physical\\nattributes of basketball, handball, and volleyball players\\nplaying in division 1 in Greece were compared. It was\\nfound that volleyball players were taller (177.1 6 6.5 cm)\\nthan both basketball (174.7 6 7.8) and handball (165.9 6\\n6.3) players. The volleyball players were also heavier\\n(69.5 6 7.4 kg), had a higher fat-free mass (53.2 6 5.3 kg),\\nand lower percent fat (23.4 6 2.8%) than the handball\\nplayers (65.1 6 9.1 kg, 48 6 6 kg, 25.9 6 3.3%, respectively).\\nIt is evident from these data and the data on volleyball\\nplayers of different proﬁciency levels that being tall is\\nadvantageous in volleyball.\\nProbably the most important aspect of describing physical\\ncharacteristics is in determining whether or not they are\\nrelated to success. A recent review on physical attributes,\\nphysiological characteristics, on-court performances, and\\nnutritional strategies of female and male basketball players\\n(36) suggested that tallness and longer arm span were\\nassociated with the top team players but not bottom team\\nplayers in one tournament. However, this observation was\\nbased on ﬁndings from 2 studies only.

In both of\\nthese studies, only descriptive statistics were provided, and\\nhence, it is unclear whether or not the differences between\\ngroups were signiﬁcant.\\nTwo studies examined changes in _VO2max throughout the\\ncompetition phase of the season. In 1 study (7) of 6 starting\\nplayers of the 1974 Case Western Reserve University inter-\\ncollegiate volleyball team, postseason _VO2max values (33.0 6\\n2.6 mlO2\\x01kg21\\x01min21) were signiﬁcantly higher than those\\nobtained in preseason (28.2 6 1.5 mlO2\\x01kg21\\x01min21). These\\nvalues were obtained from a submaximal cycle ergometer\\ntest. Another study (13) examined players from 2 volleyball\\nteams of the ofﬁcial league in Finland. The experimental team\\nhad 3–4 conditioning sessions in the preseason (one of which\\nwas dedicated to endurance training), and 2–3 conditioning\\nsessions during the season (none of which concentrated on\\nendurance training). The control team participated in only\\n1–2 conditioning sessions throughout the season. _VO2max\\nvalues were obtained from an incremental cycle ergometer\\ntest and did not change signiﬁcantly in the experimental\\nteam (pre: 47.3 6 1.7, post: 48.1 6 3.4 mlO2\\x01kg21\\x01min21) or\\nin the control team (pre: 48.2 6 2.7, post: 45.0 6 5.9\\nmlO2\\x01kg21\\x01min21). The authors of this study suggested that\\nthe weekly practices and the games played during the season\\nwere sufﬁcient in maintaining the initial aerobic capacity.\\nLastly, one study (10) examined the effects of an off-season\\n12-week supervised strength and conditioning training\\nprogram on NCAA division I players. The endurance\\nportion of the program included 4 30-minute weekly sessions\\nat 80% maximal heart rate. Endurance capacity was assessed\\nfrom a maximal effort 2-mile run. Initial values revealed no\\ndifferences in running time between starters and nonstarters\\n(999.2 6 44.3 vs. 964.4 6 88.9 seconds, respectively). Two-\\nmile running time combined for both starters and nonstarters\\n(n = 10) improved signiﬁcantly from baseline values (966.6 6\\n56.5 seconds) to the end of the 12-week program (946.2 6\\n58.2 seconds). It was suggested that these running times\\nwere reﬂective of estimated _VO2max values of about 45\\nmlO2\\x01kg21\\x01min21. Subsequent to this supervised program,\\n7 players were assessed after another 12 weeks of unsuper-\\nvised conditioning. No changes in 2-mile running times were\\nindicated after the additional 12 weeks.\\nThe\\n_VO2max values of volleyball players are similar\\nto\\nthose\\nreported\\nfor\\nbasketball\\nplayers\\n(;44.0–54.0\\nmlO2\\x01kg21\\x01min21) (36). The only exception is the unusually\\nlow values reported by Fardy et al. (7). These low values can\\nbe explained, at least in part, by the low level of the players\\nand by the testing methodology, namely, a submaximal cycle\\nergometer test.\\nStrength\\nMuscle strength is an integral part of sports performance.\\nThere are several methods for assessing muscle strength, and\\ndifferent studies use different methodologies. Hence, it is\\ndifﬁcult to compare results among studies.\\nThree studies reported isokinetic bench press and leg press\\nvalues at 20\\x02\\x01s21 (16,25,26). Two studies used the same pool\\nof players from the 1977 University of Houston Invitational\\nVolleyball Tournament. One study (16) reported values of\\n40.7 and 144.5 kg for the bench press and leg press,\\nrespectively (values presented in lbs in the original paper). In\\nthe second study (26), values were reported for players of the\\nmost successful vs. the least successful teams in the tourna-\\nment. Bench press and leg press values were 46.45 6 11.04 and\\n155.42 6 27.39 kg, respectively, for the players of the most\\nsuccessful teams, and 37.57 6 9.53 and 137.91 6 28.96 kg,\\nrespectively, for players of the least successful teams. A\\ncomparison of volleyball players, basketball players, and\\nnonplayers revealed that basketball players (bench press:\\n44.37 6 10.97 kg, leg press: 179.65 6 35.48 kg) were stronger\\nthan volleyball players (bench press: 40.59 6 9.81 kg, leg\\npress: 141.42 6 27.09 kg), and both volleyball and basketball\\nplayers were stronger than nonplayers (bench press: 30.59 6\\n8.14 kg, leg press: 128.45 6 29.68 kg) (25).\\nIsokinetic testing was also conducted in a study comparing\\nconcentric and eccentric shoulder and elbow strength in\\nfemale volleyball players and nonactive women (1). Shoulder\\nand elbow strength are important for spiking and serving. As\\nexpected, the volleyball players had signiﬁcantly higher\\nconcentric and eccentric peak torque of the shoulder and\\nelbow rotator muscles but not for concentric ﬂexion peak\\ntorque in the elbow. The authors of this study suggested that\\nthe obtained results could be explained by the fact that during\\nspiking and serving the ﬂexors of the elbow are used mainly\\nto decelerate the arm after hitting the ball. In another study\\nexamining isokinetic strength (8), a signiﬁcant correlation\\nwas found between arm extension torque at 270\\x02\\x01s21 and\\nspiking velocity. Other isokinetic torque values (e.g., hand\\nﬂexion, internal arm rotation, and forearm extension) did not\\ncorrelate with those of spiking velocity. Although correla-\\ntional in nature, these results suggest that high torque at high\\nangular velocity may be important to volleyball players. This\\nis to be expected, because high arm speeds are required for\\na volleyball spike (8).\\nWe found 4 studies that examined the effectiveness of a\\nresistance training program on strength parameters (10,13,23,31).\\nIn one study (10), the effects of a 12-week off-season training\\nVOLUME 24 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2010 | 1967\\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\\nthe\\nTM\\n| www.nsca-jscr.org'),\n",

The\\ntraining program was composed of 4 resistance training\\nsessions and 2 plyometric sessions each week. Baseline values\\nshowed that starters were, in general, stronger in concentric\\ntype exercises than nonstarters (e.g., 1 repetition maximum\\nbench press: 45.7 6 7.1 vs. 38.6 6 3.8 kg, respectively).\\nStarters remained stronger than nonstarters even after\\nabsolute values were divided by fat-free mass. However, no\\ndifferences were found in isometric- and isokinetic-type\\nexercises between starters and nonstarters. In addition, the\\n12-week program led to signiﬁcant increases in isometric and\\nconcentric strength values (e.g., 1 repetition maximum\\n[1RM] bench press; pre: 42.7 6 6.9 vs. 46.8 6 7.5 kg).\\nInterestingly, the correlation between 1RM values and 1RM\\ndivided by fat-free mass was found to become lower as the\\nseason progressed. This may suggest that, at least in part,\\nthe increase in strength was because of neural mechanisms\\nrather than a pure increase in muscle mass. Increases in\\ndynamic strength were also observed during 12 weeks of an\\nin-season resistance training program consisting of 250-\\nminute weekly sessions (23). Signiﬁcant increases were found\\nin the 4RM bench press (pre: 40 6 2.8 kg, post: 47 6 3.5 kg)\\nand the 4RM parallel squat (pre: 92 6 11.1 kg, post: 104 6\\n13.6 kg) after the 12-week program.\\nAnother study (13) examined leg extension isometric force\\nduring the competition phase in 2 groups of players from the\\nofﬁcial volleyball league in Finland. The control group\\nparticipated in 1–2 endurance and strength sessions each\\nweek and showed no improvement in force production. The\\nexperimental group participated in 3–4 conditioning sessions\\nduring the preseason (out of which 2–3 were for strength\\ndevelopment) and 2–3 sessions during the competition phase\\nof the season. The maximal rate of force development\\nincreased signiﬁcantly over 4 months in the middle of the\\nseason. However, maximal force did not increase and was\\nactually reduced by the end of the season. This reduction in\\nmaximal force occurred after a cessation of 5 weeks in the\\nresistance training. It was explained in this study that the\\noverall volume of endurance and volleyball drill training may\\nhave interfered with strength development. However, it is\\nalso likely that the testing methodology (i.e., isometric\\nstrength) failed to measure changes in dynamic strength.\\nIndeed, the players did not participate in isometric training. It\\nis possible that different strength testing protocols (e.g.,\\nconcentric strength) would have resulted in increases in\\nstrength values. Lastly, a 6-week isokinetic resistance training\\nprogram failed to increase upper-body strength as measured\\non an isokinetic machine, but increased knee extension values\\nat a velocity of 180\\x02\\x01s21 (31).\\nVertical Jump\\nVertical jump (VJ) is probably the most relevant power testing\\nprotocol for volleyball players, because it is a crucial skill in\\nthe game (e.g., in blocking and spiking). Comparing players\\nof different skill levels can show the importance of VJ in\\nvolleyball. In one study (9), a 15% difference in a counter-\\nmovement jump (CMJ) was observed in US female national\\nteam players, who jumped higher (52.4 6 4.5 cm) than\\nuniversity games team players (45.5 6 6.4 cm). Similar\\ndifferences were observed between female Pan-American (52.5\\n6 6.0 cm) and non–Pan-American players (47.3 6 4.9 cm) (32)\\nand between NCAA division I players (36.4 6 2.5 cm) and\\ndivision III players (30.2 6 7.2 cm) (3). The differences in VJ\\nvalues (;15 cm) between the 2 former studies and the latter\\nstudy can be explained by the testing apparatus used—jump\\nand mark a wall (9,32) vs. force plate measurement (3), and\\nby the skill level of the players.\\nVertical jump performance also appeared to be related to\\nsuccess in a national volleyball tournament. Standing reach,\\nVJ, and absolute jump height were correlated with the ﬁnal\\nranking of the teams (r = 0.44–0.63) during the 1974 US\\nNational Championship Tournament (11). The authors of\\nthis study suggested that a ‘‘critical height’’ above the net\\nexists for optimal spiking and blocking and that the players\\nwho are able to reach this threshold have an advantage over\\nthose players who fail to reach it. However, a later study (22)\\ndid not ﬁnd VJ performance to be a contributing factor\\ndiscriminating between winning and losing teams. Similarly,\\nno relationships between VJ and spiking velocity were found\\nin a study of NCAA division I female players (8). Although VJ\\nability is assumed to be a factor in improving volleyball play,\\ndata regarding its importance in predicting success and\\ndifferentiating winning from losing teams are lacking.\\nIt is important to determine whether speciﬁc conditioning\\nprograms can help maintain or even increase jumping ability\\nduring the season. In 1 study (28), after 7 weeks of in-season\\nheavy resistance training, a number of VJ values (e.g., height\\nof jump, power, and velocity) failed to increase. In fact, values\\nof approach jump and reach actually decreased from 61.2 6\\n5.6 to 57.9 6 5.3 cm.

Spike jump and block jump\\nvalues did not signiﬁcantly change throughout the season.\\nIt is possible that the extra 7 practices included in the\\n2004–2005 preseason may have led to fatigue and to reduced\\nperformance.\\nVarious types of ergogenic aids are used by athletes to\\nimprove VJ performance, among them compressive garments\\nsuch as tights and elastic shorts. One study (18) examined\\nwhether compression garments affect jump performance.\\nEighteen NCAA division I players were examined on 10\\nmaximal CMJs with hands kept on the waist throughout the\\njumping performances. Although the compression shorts did\\nnot inﬂuence maximal jump power, they did help maintain\\npower production over repeated jumps. Although the rea-\\nsons for the beneﬁts of using the compression shorts were\\nunclear, the authors of this study suggested they might be\\nassociated with the increased proprioceptive cues resulting\\nfrom the tight feel of the garment. More research is needed to\\ncorroborate these ﬁndings.\\nAgility and Speed\\nAgility and speed are integral aspects of almost every\\ndefensive and offensive maneuver performed by volleyball\\nplayers. Various types of agility and speed test protocols are\\navailable, and therefore, comparisons among studies can be\\ndifﬁcult. Researchers are advised to consider speciﬁcity when\\nchoosing a test protocol from the ones available in the\\nliterature.\\nTwo studies examined the effects of strength and condi-\\ntioning programs on agility and speed in female volleyball\\nplayers (10,27). In one study (10), NCAA division I starters\\nand nonstarters underwent 12-weeks of an off-season con-\\nditioning program that included 4 weekly strength training\\nsessions, 2 weekly plyometric sessions, and 4 weekly endu-\\nrance sessions (30-minute runs at ;80% of maximal heart\\nrate). Speed tests included 10-yd (9.1 m) and 40-yd (36.6 m)\\nruns. A T-test—running forward for 9.1 m, shufﬂing left or\\nright for 4.6 m, shufﬂing to the other side for 9.1 m, shufﬂing\\nback 4.6 m, and back-pedaling for 9.1 m—was used to test the\\nplayers’ agility. Running times were measured by a handheld\\nstopwatch. These tests were performed 2 weeks into the\\n12-week program and at the end of the program. The results\\nindicated that starters preformed better on the 40-yd (36.6 m)\\nsprint compared to nonstarters (5.56 6 0.23 vs. 5.84 6 0.24\\nseconds, respectively). However, no differences were found\\nbetween starters and nonstarters in the 10-yd (9.1 m) run\\n(1.55 6 0.42 vs. 1.84 6 0.09 seconds, respectively) and the\\nagility T-test (10.78 6 0.19 vs. 11.04 6 0.44 seconds). Pooled\\ndata for both starters and nonstarters revealed that the\\n12-week conditioning program actually reduced perfor-\\nmance in the agility T-test (pre: 10.87 6 0.34 seconds, post:\\n11.16 6 0.38 seconds), whereas no changes were observed in\\nthe 10-yd (pre: 1.67 6 0.35 seconds, post: 1.82 6 0.07 sec-\\nonds) and 40-yd (pre: 5.67 6 0.28 seconds, post: 5.62 6 0.24\\nseconds) sprints. The authors suggested that these values\\nprobably reﬂected the lack of speed and agility drills during\\nthe 12-week program and that most likely strength and\\nplyometric training alone cannot improve speed and agility.\\nAnother study (27) examined the effectiveness of 2 weeks\\nof preseason conditioning in 2 consecutive seasons (2004–\\n2005, 2005–2006) in NCAA division I volleyball players.\\nThe 2004–2005 preseason included 24 practice sessions, 12\\nstrength training sessions, and 2 rest days within 2 weeks.\\nThe 2005–2006 preseason included 17 practice sessions, 10\\nstrength training sessions, and 1 rest day within 2 weeks.

During the 2004–2005 season, T-test performance\\ndeteriorated from baseline values (10.12 6 0.5 seconds) by\\nthe end of the preseason (10.33 6 0.7 seconds) but returned\\nto baseline values by the end of the competition phase of the\\nseason (9.79 6 0.5 seconds). In contrast, during the 2005–\\n2006 season, T-test performance improved signiﬁcantly at the\\nend of the preseason (9.69 6 0.6 seconds) compared to base-\\nline values (10.01 6 0.6) and continued to improve toward\\nthe end of the competition phase of the season (9.17 6 0.8).\\nThese data suggest that athletes may have been overly\\nfatigued after the 2004–2005 preseason, which included\\n24 practice sessions and 12 strength training sessions. In the\\n2005–2006 season, even though 7 fewer practices and 2 fewer\\nstrength training sessions were conducted, the athletes’\\nperformance improved.\\nThe intensity of the preseason program can result in\\nan imbalance between training load and recovery. Coaches\\nshould understand that too much training can lead to reduced\\nperformance. Speciﬁcally, volleyball coaches and strength\\nand conditioning coaches should be aware of the concepts of\\nfunctional overreaching, nonfunctional overreaching, and\\novertraining. Functional overreaching is a state in which\\nreduced performance because of training stress eventually\\nleads to improvement in performance after recovery. Non-\\nfunctional overreaching is a state in which the training load is\\ngreater than the recovery allowed, and performance is\\nreduced for a short term, usually without physiological and\\npsychological signs. Lastly, overtraining is a state in which the\\nincreased accumulation of training with inadequate recovery\\nleads to long-term reduced performance accompanied by\\nphysiological and psychological maladaptations (24).\\nSimilar values of a 20-yd (18.3-m) dash were found in 3\\nstudies (16,26,32): 3.05 6 0.17 seconds in 180 collegiate\\nplayers (16), 3.12 6 0.13 seconds in 15 members of the 1975\\nUS women’s volleyball training team (32), and 2.98 seconds\\nvs. 3.14 seconds in the most successful vs. the least successful\\nplayers in the 1977 University of Houston Invitational\\nVolleyball Tournament (26). In the latter study (26), 20-yd\\ndash values were reported separately for the ﬁrst 10 yd and\\nfor the next 10–20 yd. Other sprint times reported were\\n1.05 6 0.05 seconds for a 5-m dash (35) and 1.68 6 0.095\\nseconds for a 10-yd dash (9.91 m) (25). Also in this study (25),\\na comparison between volleyball and basketball players was\\nmade. It was found that basketball players were slower\\n(1.72 6 0.1 seconds) than volleyball players. Both volleyball\\nand basketball players were faster than nonathletes (1.88 6\\n0.13 seconds).\\nOne study (3) used a unique testing apparatus that was\\nmade of a 6-m 3 1-m platform with a built-in force platform.\\nTwenty-nine NCAA division I–III players ran 5 m back and\\nforth 4 times, starting and ending on the force platform. No\\ndifferences in running times were found between division\\nI–III players. Agility running times correlated signiﬁcantly\\nwith CMJ heights (r = 20.58). In fact, jump height explained\\n34% of the variance in agility running times. Lastly, a dis-\\ncriminate analysis evaluating factors that differentiated the\\nwinning teams from the losing teams in these Divisions found\\nagility to be an important discriminator (22).\\nON-COURT PERFORMANCE\\nPhysiological variables such as heart rate and blood lactate\\nshould be measured under ﬁeld conditions so that coaches\\ncan be provided with relevant information on the physical\\ndemands of the volleyball game. Information on patterns of\\nmovements and actions performed by volleyball players\\nduring the game should be also collected and analyzed. These\\nmeasurements refer to notational analysis or time–motion\\nanalysis, which are used to quantify the number and types of\\nmovements performed by the players during a game. Unfor-\\ntunately, we found no studies using time–motion analysis, but\\n2 studies examining on-court physiological variables were\\ndiscovered (7,19). Time–motion analysis in men’s volleyball\\nreveals that most rallies last less than 12 seconds, with a range\\nof 3–40 seconds. Rest periods between rallies were also\\n12 seconds or less (30). Although it is appealing to think that\\nvolleyball rallies of female players are similar to those of male\\nplayers, this cannot be known without performing time–\\nmotion analyses in women’s games as well.\\nIn one study (7), heart rates during volleyball practices and\\ngames were measured in 6 nonelite female players. Heart\\nrates during practice averaged 134 b\\x01min21 and ranged from\\n120 to 161 b\\x01min21. During an actual game, heart rates\\naveraged 139 b\\x01min21 and ranged from 116 to 172 b\\x01min21.\\nMean heart rate was the highest during spiking (138 b\\x01min21)\\nand lowest while serving (104 b\\x01min21). For this small\\nsample, volleyball play appeared to be only moderately\\nstrenuous, with heart rates corresponding to ;55–60%\\nof _VO2max.\\nIn another study (19), lactate concentrations were mea-\\nsured in players of the ﬁrst German league in 1983–1984.\\nLactate values did not change signiﬁcantly from pre to\\npostgame and remained around 2–2.5 mmol\\x01L21. It was\\nexplained by the authors of this study that during volleyball\\ngames, most of the energy requirements are supplied by\\nphosphagen breakdown, with only a minor contribution\\nfrom anaerobic glycolysis. Although this is theoretically\\nplausible, more research is needed to understand the\\nmetabolic pathways in use during female volleyball games.\\nCONDITIONING FOR VOLLEYBALL\\nThe use of data from on-court performance studies and from\\nexperiments examining methods of improving physiological\\nvariables can enable strength and conditioning coaches to\\ncreate useful conditioning programs. Although a conceptual-\\nized review on conditioning programs in volleyball is beyond\\nthe scope of this article, a short overview is warranted.

For\\nexample, lateral movements are often performed in volley-\\nball, whereas most strength exercises are executed in the\\nsagittal plane, and therefore, coaches should include exercises\\nsuch as lateral squats and side lunges in their training\\nprograms. Plyometric exercises, such as lateral box jumps and\\nlateral bounds, should also be included. In addition, dumbbell\\ntraining should be considered as an important part of the\\nconditioning program, because it improves balance and body\\ncontrol. Also, trunk training is essential because the game of\\nvolleyball requires movements such as running, twisting, and\\njumping, which can create strenuous forces on the back.\\nUsually, trunk exercises are performed in the supine position.\\nIn volleyball, based on the principle of speciﬁcity, some of the\\nexercises should be done standing up.\\nA strong trunk must be accompanied by a strong upper\\nbody. A strong upper body will allow for higher-velocity\\nspikes and improved VJ and will help prevent injuries in the\\nshoulder joint musculature, which is stressed in the game of\\nvolleyball. Lastly, training should aim at improving VJ,\\nbecause it is one of the most important aspects of the game. In\\na follow-up article (15), Hedrick presented a fully detailed\\nconditioning\\nprogram\\nbased\\non\\nthe\\nabovementioned\\nprinciples.\\nMETHODOLOGICAL AND MEASUREMENT CONCERNS\\nBased on the reviewed studies dealing with the physical\\nattributes, physiological attributes, and on-court perform-\\nances of female volleyball players, 3 methodological and\\nmeasurement concerns are discussed. (a) The lack of studies\\nusing a time–motion analysis. In only 2 studies (7,19) were\\ndata obtained on physiological attributes of female volleyball\\nplayers during actual games. Information on what actions\\nplayers actually perform during the game, such as the\\nnumber of VJ performances in defensive (e.g., blocking) and\\noffensive (e.g., spiking) maneuvers, is crucial in developing\\nappropriate training programs. As in other ball games (e.g.,\\nbasketball [36]), more studies collecting data on on-court\\nperformances in volleyball are required. A systematic\\nobservation of the main actions demonstrated by volleyball\\nplayers during games should be carefully conducted, and an\\nin-depth analysis of the performed on-court performances\\nshould be undertaken. By understanding the physiological\\ndemands of volleyball players during a game, strength and\\nconditioning coaches can effectively plan their strength and\\nconditioning programs, matching them to the speciﬁc needs\\nof each player. (b) The lack of experimental studies. In recent\\nreviews of observational\\nand experimental studies on\\nphysical attributes and physiological characteristics (36)\\nand VJ (37) of female and male basketball players, it was\\nargued that more studies should encourage implementation\\nof conditioning programs for agility and speed, and for power\\nand strength, with at least one intervention group and one\\ncontrol. This observation can also be made based on the\\ncurrent review of female volleyball players. Only 4 studies\\nwere found to examine the contribution of a resistance\\ntraining program to strength parameters (10,13,23,31). More\\nmultigroup studies are needed to compare the effectiveness\\nof the different strength and conditioning programs given to\\nfemale volleyball players. The knowledge emerging from\\nthese studies will help coaches assess the contribution of\\ndifferent programs to the development of their players and\\nassist them in better matching the program to the speciﬁc\\nneeds of the individual player. (c) The use of multiple testing\\nprotocols and settings. Various tests examining physiological\\nattributes were used in the reviewed studies, among them\\nbeing agility and speed and VJ tests. To compare data from\\ndifferent studies, it is essential to know the speciﬁc protocol of\\nthe test and its selected testing device and setting. In addition,\\nnorms established based on the results of one physical test\\ncannot be used to assess results achieved in another test.\\nTherefore, a careful selection of the testing protocol and\\ndevice should be made. For example, if the objective of the\\nresearcher is to study the jumping ability of the players in\\nspiking, then a\\njumping test allowing approach and the use of hands should\\nbe selected. In this case, the test should mimic the unique\\nactions demonstrated by the player while jumping in an\\nactual game.\\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\\nBased on the reviewed studies, 3 practical implications are\\nsuggested for volleyball coaches and strength and condition-\\ning coaches who work with female volleyball players. (a) The\\namount of training should be carefully monitored when\\nplanning strength and conditioning programs. To achieve\\na high level of proﬁciency in volleyball, a proper balance\\nbetween volume and intensity of training is required, and\\nappropriate rest periods between training sessions. If the\\ncorrect balance between volume, intensity, and frequency of\\ntraining does not exist, overreaching and overtraining can\\noccur. Although functional overreaching can lead to an\\neventual increased performance, both nonfunctional over-\\nreaching and overtraining can lead to diminished perfor-\\nmance\\nfor\\nshort\\nand\\nlong\\nperiods\\nof\\ntime.\\nMaking\\na differential diagnosis between nonfunctional overreaching\\nand overtraining is difﬁcult and depends on clinical outcomes.\\nHowever, a key term in the recognition of overtraining is\\n‘‘prolonged maladaptation’’ of the athlete and of several\\nbiological regulation mechanisms (24). Overtraining is also\\ncharacterized by diminished performance, increased fatigue,\\nand stress (34), and therefore maintaining the balance\\nbetween training and recovery is essential in monitoring\\nthe players’ activities during the annual training program (see\\na review by Meeusen et al. on overreaching and overtraining\\n[24]). (b) The volleyball program should include ballistic-\\ntype or plyometric training (i.e., power training). As indicated\\nin the current review, traditional resistance training is not\\nenough to improve the performances of female volleyball\\nplayers, especially those that comprise VJ—blocking, serving,\\nVOLUME 24 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2010 | 1971\\nJournal of Strength and Conditioning Research\\nthe\\nTM\\n| www.nsca-jscr.org'),\n",

Therefore, explosive-type strength training and\\nplyometric training in particular should be included in the\\ntraining program to enable the players to improve their leg\\nmuscle power in the overall conditioning program. (c) Pre-\\nvention of injury should be considered when planning condi-\\ntioning programs. For example, as suggested by Marques\\net al. (23), inexperienced players should avoid jump training\\nwith heavy loads and should focus on enhancing strength\\nand improving jumping technique. Only after a strong\\nfoundation in strength training is achieved should ballistic\\ntraining begin. In another example, patellar tendinopathy\\n(i.e., jumper’s knee) is an overuse injury that can be caused by\\nan increase in the volume of jumping training and occurs\\nmore frequently when athletes practice on hard, unforgiving\\nsurfaces (29). Therefore, the type of surface on which the\\nathletes practice is of considerable importance.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThe authors would like to thank Dinah Olswang for her\\neditorial assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.\\nNo sources of funding were used to assist in the preparation of\\nthis review.

      "way. It is not that AI needs definition; it is\n",
      "more that AI needs substance, a distinction\n",

      "When someone who is not in AI asks where\n",
      "the AI is, what assumptions about AI are\n",
      "inherent in the question? There seem to be at\n",
      "least four prevailing viewpoints that I have to\n",

      "one of the following four things: (1) AI means\n",
      "magic bullets, (2) AI means inference engines,\n",
      "(3) AI means getting a machine to do some-\n",
      "thing you didn’t think a machine could do\n",
      "(the “gee whiz” view), and (4) AI means\n",
      "having a machine learn.\n",
      "The magic bullet view of AI is as follows:\n",
      "Intelligence is actually difficult to put into a\n",
      "machine because it is knowledge dependent.\n",
      "Because the knowledge-acquisition process is\n",
      "complex, one way to address it is to finesse it.\n",
      "Let the machine be efficient computationally\n",
      "so that it can connect things to each other\n",
      "without having to explicitly represent any-\n",
      "thing. In this way, the intelligence comes for\n",
      "free as a by-product of unanticipated connec-\n",
      "tions that the machine makes.\n",
      "An alternate version of this view is that AI\n",
      "is something that one could, in principle, dis-\n",
      "cover in one’s garage. What the form of this\n",
      "discovery might be remains a mystery, but\n",
      "one would drop the discovered item or tech-\n",
      "nique into the machine, and it would become\n",

      "Suppose his program had determined\n",
      "which of the numbers 1 through 10 had been\n",
      "said by comparing the sound that was received\n",

      "had to address this issue. In other words, the\n",

      "Now, obviously, I decided that his solution\n",

      "would not scale up. This conclusion was easy\n",

      "selection process they underwent.\n",
      "Physical characteristics can differentiate among players of\n",

      "level players, other studies showed that players of higher\n",

      "between players of different positions in divisions A1 and A2\n",
      "in the Greek ﬁrst national league were examined. Hitters,\n",
      "centers, and setters were signiﬁcantly taller in division A1\n",
      "(181.2 6 4.5, 182.0 6 4.6, and 176.9 6 4.1 cm, respectively)\n",
      "compared to division A2 (173.4 6 6.2, 178.7 6 4.9, and\n",
      "170.9 6 4.2 cm, respectively). No differences in body mass\n",
      "were found between players of the 2 divisions. Differences in\n",
      "percent body fat were found only in opposites (A1: 20.5 6\n",
      "3.0% vs. A2: 25.7 6 3.4%). In this study (21), the physical\n",

      "hitters, liberos, and setters.\n",
      "Three studies examined changes in physical characteristics\n",
      "over time (10,13,17). No changes in body mass, percent fat,\n",

      "baseline values, whereas body mass remained stable. In\n",

      "percent fat throughout the entire season. Although an\n",
      "increase in percent fat can hinder performance, it should be\n",
      "noted that the changes indicated in all studies were small and\n",
      "could have been affected, at least in part, by the accuracy of\n",
      "the type of instruments used and the measuring methods. In\n",
      "addition, even if the data reﬂect actual changes in body\n",
      "composition, this does not necessarily mean that these\n",

      "over time, as Johnson et al. (17) suggested, and therefore,\n",

      "each individual player.\n",
      "Comparing volleyball players to players of other team\n",
      "sports and to nonathletes can shed light on the physical\n",
      "attributes that are unique to those players. In one study (25),\n",

      "attributes of basketball, handball, and volleyball players\n",
      "playing in division 1 in Greece were compared. It was\n",
      "found that volleyball players were taller (177.1 6 6.5 cm)\n",
      "than both basketball (174.7 6 7.8) and handball (165.9 6\n",
      "6.3) players. The volleyball players were also heavier\n",
      "(69.5 6 7.4 kg), had a higher fat-free mass (53.2 6 5.3 kg),\n",
      "and lower percent fat (23.4 6 2.8%) than the handball\n",
      "players (65.1 6 9.1 kg, 48 6 6 kg, 25.9 6 3.3%, respectively).\n",
      "It is evident from these data and the data on volleyball\n",
      "players of different proﬁciency levels that being tall is\n",
      "advantageous in volleyball.\n",
      "Probably the most important aspect of describing physical\n",

      "physiological characteristics, on-court performances, and\n",

      "associated with the top team players but not bottom team\n",
      "players in one tournament. However, this observation was\n",
      "based on ﬁndings from 2 studies only. Similarly, we found\n",

      "Vertical jump performance also appeared to be related to\n",
      "success in a national volleyball tournament. Standing reach,\n",

      "data obtained on physiological attributes of female volleyball\n",
      "players during actual games. Information on what actions\n",

      "conditioning coaches can effectively plan their strength and\n",
      "conditioning programs, matching them to the speciﬁc needs\n",
      "of each player. (b) The lack of experimental studies. In recent\n",
      "reviews of observational\n",
      "and experimental studies on\n",
      "physical attributes and physiological characteristics (36)\n",
      "and VJ (37) of female and male basketball players, it was\n",
      "argued that more studies should encourage implementation\n",
      "of conditioning programs for agility and speed, and for power\n",
      "and strength, with at least one intervention group and one\n",
      "control. This observation can also be made based on the\n",
      "current review of female volleyball players. Only 4 studies\n",
      "were found to examine the contribution of a resistance\n",
      "training program to strength parameters (10,13,23,31). More\n",
      "multigroup studies are needed to compare the effectiveness\n",

      "different programs to the development of their players and\n",

      "needs of the individual player. (c) The use of multiple testing\n",
      "protocols and settings. Various tests examining physiological\n",
      "attributes were used in the reviewed studies, among them\n",
      "being agility and speed and VJ tests. To compare data from\n",

      "the test and its selected testing device and setting. In addition,\n",
      "norms established based on the results of one physical test\n",
      "cannot be used to assess results achieved in another test.\n",
      "Therefore, a careful selection of the testing protocol and\n",
      "device should be made. For example, if the objective of the\n",
      "researcher is to study the jumping ability of the players in\n",
      "spiking, then a\n",
      "jumping test allowing approach and the use of hands should\n",

      "PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\n",
      "Based on the reviewed studies, 3 practical implications are\n",
      "suggested for volleyball coaches and strength and condition-\n",
      "ing coaches who work with female volleyball players. (a) The\n",
      "amount of training should be carefully monitored when\n",
      "planning strength and conditioning programs. To achieve\n",
      "a high level of proﬁciency in volleyball, a proper balance\n",
      "between volume and intensity of training is required, and\n",
      "appropriate rest periods between training sessions. If the\n",
      "correct balance between volume, intensity, and frequency of\n",
      "training does not exist, overreaching and overtraining can\n",

      "a differential diagnosis between nonfunctional overreaching\n",
      "and overtraining is difﬁcult and depends on clinical outcomes.\n",
      "However, a key term in the recognition of overtraining is\n",
      "‘‘prolonged maladaptation’’ of the athlete and of several\n",
      "biological regulation mechanisms (24). Overtraining is also\n",
      "characterized by diminished performance, increased fatigue,\n",

      "the players’ activities during the annual training program (see\n",
