####Simple RAG Project (Learning Project)

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
It was created as a learning project to understand how modern LLMs can combine external knowledge retrieval with natural language generation.

The goal of this project was to explore the core ideas behind RAG systems in a simple and hands-on way.

###🔍 What the Project Does

##The project demonstrates how to:

Load documents (text or PDF)

Split them into chunks

Create vector embeddings

Store embeddings in a vector database (FAISS)

Retrieve the most relevant chunks for a user question

Feed the retrieved context into a model to generate an answer

This pipeline shows how retrieval improves the accuracy of LLM responses by grounding them in actual data.

##🧩 Why This Project Exists

This was built as a learning exercise, not as a production system.

The main purpose was to understand:

How embeddings work

How to build a minimal vector store

How retrieval improves LLM responses

How to connect retrieval → generation in a single flow

It served as a great introduction to building AI assistants and Q&A systems that rely on external knowledge.
